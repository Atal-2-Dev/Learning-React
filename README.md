# Learning-React

## Day 1 - Basics of React, why use it and JSX.
- Refreshed the knowledge of js.
- Learnt new things possible in vanilla js like manipulating contents in html file without using inner HTML.
- Imperative (tell the computer exactly how to do) vs Declarative (tell the computer what to do) programming - This is one important reason why we use React.
- JSX, a syntax -perhaps more than just a syntax that allows us to get the directive script in the form of JS objects- that makes the job easier. JSX retuns normal js objects under the hood but looks like html.
- Learnt what difference does the DOM render make - compared to the other ways like trying to append js variable to the HTML element.

## Day 2 - Set up React App
- React components (Function that returns React elements) and React elements (Objects that get created when we return JSX).
- Set up Local React environment with Create React App and learnt how to use it.
- Basics of working with files, connecting to one another, some changes needed in switching from React 17 to React 18 and working with directories.

## Day 3 - Figma
- Created an account and played with the tools around a little. The basic layout of the current webpage was designed.

## Day 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 - Got busy with other stuff. React became low in priority, especially because of research and interviews.

## Day 16 - Restarting
- Took a while to gather everything up again. Did a task too. Now ready to continue learning.
- Got back to the same YouTube tutorial. Create a new project too. All the learning will happen there.

## Day 17 
- index.html -> Only for root. | index.js -> Contains App component (renders this) and imports index.css. | App.js -> Contains other components. | index.css -> import the google fonts here.
