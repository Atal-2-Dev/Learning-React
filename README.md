# Learning-React

## Day 1 - Basics of React. Why use it?
- Refreshed the knowledge of js.
- Learnt new things possible in the vanilla js like manipulating contents in html file without using a inner HTML.
- Imperative (tell computer exactly how to do) vs Declarative (tell the computer what to do) programming - This is one important reason why we use React.
