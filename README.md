# Learning-React

## Day 1 - Basics of React, why use it and JSX.
- Refreshed the knowledge of js.
- Learnt new things possible in the vanilla js like manipulating contents in html file without using a inner HTML.
- Imperative (tell computer exactly how to do) vs Declarative (tell the computer what to do) programming - This is one important reason why we use React.
- JSX, a syntax -perhaps more than just a syntax that allows us to get directive script in the form of js objects- that makes job easier. JSX retuns normal js objects under the hood but looks like html.
- Learnt what difference does the DOM render make - comparing to the other ways like trying to append js variable to the HTML element.

## Day 2 - Set up React App
- React components (Function that returns React elements) and React elements (Objects that get created when we return jsx).
- Set up React App and learnt how to use it locally.
